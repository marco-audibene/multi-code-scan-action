# Salesforce Code Quality Test Workflow
#
# Purpose:
# This workflow tests the action against sample Salesforce code files using custom rulesets.
# It uses test files from the language-tests/salesforce/files directory and 
# rulesets from the language-tests/salesforce/rulesets directory.
#
# The test files contain intentional code quality issues that should be detected by the action.
