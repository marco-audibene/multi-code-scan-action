# Self-Test Workflow
#
# Purpose:
# This workflow runs the action against its own codebase ("dogfooding").
# It verifies that the action can successfully:
#   1. Install required tools (ESLint)
#   2. Scan JavaScript files in the src/ directory
#   3. Detect code quality violations
#   4. Report results
#
# When it runs:
# - On push to main branch (except for documentation changes)
# - On pull requests targeting main branch
#
# This is different from unit tests (npm test) which verify the internal
# functionality of the code. This workflow tests the action as a whole.
